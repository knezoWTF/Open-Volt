# OpenVolt

A 1.21.1 client (for 1.9 combat).

This client is still going to be worked on.

# Why?

The client was originally meant to be paid, but I decided to make it FOSS. Hopefully, the community can come together to make this client better than every other client available.

# People Who Helped Make Volt Happen

Lvstrng (1037070137041375412) – Client base + Click Simulation

Koi (1227992566339731479) – The best person I could have met, helped a lot with Volt and knows 1.9 combat better than I do

Etho (1383737664645369926) – Moral support & Walmart Solutions

3000IQPlay (1193266310977691760) – Gave me help on what to do with Volt (also made Walmart Solutions, which made me try 1.21)
